                        <p>Howdy! My name is Matthew Qian, and I am a sophomore Computer Science major at Texas A&M, 
                            part of the class of 2027. I was born in Indiana, but have lived the past 7 years in 
                            Katy, Texas, near the Houston area. I am also pursuing a double degree in Applied
                            Mathematics, with an emphasis in economics. On this page you can find my technical portfolio,
                            resume, qualifications, areas of interest, and service done for the community.
                        </p>

                <div id="box3"><h3>Interests</h3></div>
                <div id="box4">
                    <p> I am interested in music - I play the piano! In addition, I like puzzles, reading, 
                        and spending quality time with my family and others. I also like to spend my free time going 
                        to the gym and playing pool (even if I still am terrible at it). And last but not least,
                        I love to code! I have been programming since middle school and treat every problem as a fun
                        puzzle that needs to be figured out and solved. The free reign typically associated with programming
                        lets me be on a level of creativity you can't find in other STEM related majors.
                        You can also find more about my major specific areas of interest (machine learning, artificial intelligence, etc)
                        under the qualifications section. </p>

                <div id="box5"><h3>Values</h3></div>
                <div id="box6">
                    <p>I think values are essential in being able to have a strong moral foundation that allows us to make the right choices, especially when faced with tough situations. It's very important to ensure that a company's values align with yours, otherwise you potentially face a miserable workplace. 
                    </p>
                    <p>As for me, I consider honesty, integrity, and respect to be extremely valuable. These three help build trust and create a safe environment for everyone. In addition, I think responsibility, open-mindedness, and kindness also go a long way. It's important to be able to own up to mistakes as well as encourage the ideas of others; it promotes creativity and friendliness that will help everyone out in the long run.
