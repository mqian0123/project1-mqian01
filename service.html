                    <p id="text1"><a href="https://bigevent.tamu.edu/">Big Event</a> is one of the largest service projects in the country, where thousands
                        of Aggies come together and help residents out by doing yard work, painting, and maintenence.
                        I also participated in Big Event and spent a day cleaning out the backyard of a resident by
                        trimming trees and bushes, raking all the leaves, and washing the walls of the home.

                    <p id="text1">The <a href="https://www.houstonfoodbank.org/">Houston Food Bank</a> is a great foundation that helps feed millions in not just Houston,
                        but a large portion of Texas. I have spent many hours volunteering at the Houston Food Bank,
                        with each time being as rewarding as the last. I have helped with distribution, packaging,
                        sorting, and recycling. They always need as much help as they can get,
                        and you should volunteer if you can!</p>

                    <p>I would love to also help out more with A&M events, such as local coding competitions, hackathons,
                        and reaching out to the younger generation to get them more excited about learning in general. I
                        plan to continue with Big Event, and hope to help out the loving community here in College Station!
